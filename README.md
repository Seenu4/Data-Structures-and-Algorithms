These algorithms are fundamental in data structures for solving graph and optimization problems. They include techniques for finding shortest paths (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall), graph traversal (BFS, DFS), and constructing minimum spanning trees (Prim, Kruskal). Dynamic programming is a broader optimization approach used in various problems.
